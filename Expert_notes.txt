Temperature	- Adjust thermostat
Nitrite		- Nitrite too high -> water change 30% weekly, or bacterial starter should be near 0
Nitrate		- Plant food, too high-> green water. Too high -> water change 30% weekly, more plants, less food, less fish(?)

pH		-  too high -> add peat, too low-> baking soda
GH(Mg & Ca)	-  Expert says it's not important  
KH		- Expert says it's not important
Chlorine	- If chlorine =/= 0, use chlorine treatment on water changes

width, breadth, height

Mystery fish

Big fish eats small fish!

Algae:
	Visually detectable (brown hairs, green water, green threads, red algae)
	Brown hairs - Low CO2 -> moving water, adding bubles or CO2
	Green water/threads: Too much light & overfeeding
	
Lighting:
	Have lighting, aquarium intended
	8 hours of light (7 if algae) (at Daytime!)
		
	
Stress:
	Decolorizes
	Plants/structures
	Big&scary fish
	Having same species
	Have regular lighting	
	(Can cause diseases)

General maintenance:
	Water changes
	(recommended) Use vacuum thing
	Clean filter
	/Have timed lighting
	Have grit (holds bacteria)
	Cycle aquarium before adding fish
	No fish bowls	
	(optional) plant food

Diseases:
	Fin rot
	Zwemblaas ontsteking
